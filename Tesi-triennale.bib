	abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Pixel Stream Editor. This forms the basis for an interactive synthesizer for designing highly realistic Computer Generated Imagery. The designer works in an interactive Very High Level programming environment which provides a very fast concept/implement/view iteration cycle.Naturalistic visual complexity is built up by composition of non-linear functions, as opposed to the more conventional texture mapping or growth model algorithms. Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of {CGI}.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal. The algorithms created with this paradigm are generally extremely fast, highly realistic, and asynchronously parallelizable at the pixel level.},

Relying on such datasets requires awareness of the potential bias in their content and characteristics: some methods are designed to rely on the presence of particular elements, such as human skin, while other methods learn implicit relationships between image content and light properties from training data. The dependency on these relationships makes it fundamental to understand whether the available datasets are actually representative of common application scenarios, such as the presence of human subjects, the diversity of composition, or the illumination conditions. In this paper we overview the most common datasets for Automatic White Balance, including those for single as well as multiple illuminant estimation, providing a critical analysis on their characteristics. Furthermore, we identify a number of existing methods for single illuminant estimation, as a representative pool of approaches to the problem with various levels of complexity. We investigate how the performance of these correlate to the image content of common datasets.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2502.03494},
	abstract = {Traditional auto white balance ({AWB}) algorithms typically assume a single global illuminant source, which leads to color distortions in multi-illuminant scenes. While recent neural network-based methods have shown excellent accuracy in such scenarios, their high parameter count and computational demands limit their practicality for real-time video applications. The Fast Fourier Color Constancy ({FFCC}) algorithm was proposed for single-illuminant-source scenes, predicting a global illuminant source with high efficiency. However, it cannot be directly applied to multi-illuminant scenarios unless specifically modified. To address this, we propose Integral Fast Fourier Color Constancy ({IFFCC}), an extension of {FFCC} tailored for multi-illuminant scenes. {IFFCC} leverages the proposed integral {UV} histogram to accelerate histogram computations across all possible regions in Cartesian space and parallelizes Fourier-based convolution operations, resulting in a spatially-smooth illumination map. This approach enables high-accuracy, real-time {AWB} in multi-illuminant scenes. Extensive experiments show that {IFFCC} achieves accuracy that is on par with or surpasses that of pixel-level neural networks, while reducing the parameter count by over \$400{\textbackslash}times\$ and processing speed by 20 - \$100{\textbackslash}times\$ faster than network-based approaches.},

By using n diagonal matrices along with a weight, the proposed method can reduce lighting effects on all spatially varying colors in an image under such illumination conditions. In contrast, conventional white balance adjustments do not consider the correcting of all colors except under a single illuminant. Also, multi-color balance adjustments can map multiple colors into corresponding ground truth colors, although they may cause the rank deficiency problem to occur as a non-diagonal matrix is used, unlike white balancing. In an experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown under mixed and non-uniform illuminants, compared with conventional white and multi-color balancing. Moreover, under a single illuminant, the proposed method has almost the same performance as the conventional white balancing.},

	abstract = {Computational color constancy has the important task of reducing the influence of the scene illumination on the object colors. As such, it is an essential part of the image processing pipelines of most digital cameras. One of the important parts of the computational color constancy is illumination estimation, i.e. estimating the illumination color. When an illumination estimation method is proposed, its accuracy is usually reported by providing the values of error metrics obtained on the images of publicly available datasets. However, over time it has been shown that many of these datasets have problems such as too few images, inappropriate image quality, lack of scene diversity, absence of version tracking, violation of various assumptions, {GDPR} regulation violation, lack of additional shooting procedure info, etc. In this paper, a new illumination estimation dataset is proposed that aims to alleviate many of the mentioned problems and to help the illumination estimation research. It consists of 4890 images with known illumination colors as well as with additional semantic data that can further make the learning process more accurate. Due to the usage of the {SpyderCube} color target, for every image there are two ground-truth illumination records covering different directions. Because of that, the dataset can be used for training and testing of methods that perform single or two-illuminant estimation. This makes it superior to many similar existing datasets. The datasets, it's smaller version {SimpleCube}++, and the accompanying code are available at https://github.com/Visillect/{CubePlusPlus}/.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale publicly available color constancy dataset which we are calling the Shadows \& Lumination dataset. The dataset contains 2500 minimally processed images from various indoor, outdoor, and night-time scenes. This dataset is {GDPR}-compliant, as we masked out all sensitive private information from the images. Unlike most other color constancy datasets, our dataset contains real-world images with two illuminants is appropriate for multi-illuminant estimation. In addition to the illumination, we provide a binary segmentation mask for each image. In the segmentation mask, we divide the image into two regions, where each region is illuminated by only one of the illuminants. We give an explanation of the methodology used to create the dataset. For dataset creation, we used five cameras: Canon 5D, Canon 550D, Sony α300, Panasonic {FZ}1000, and the Motorola one fusion+ mobile camera. Finally, we tested several state-of-the-art illumination estimation and image segmentation models on our dataset. The dataset is publicly available11bit.ly/shal\_dataset Direct link.. This paper also benchmarks several illumination estimation methods as well as several image segmentation methods on our dataset.},

	abstract = {Computational color constancy algorithms are commonly evaluated only through angular error analysis on annotated datasets of static images. The widespread use of videos in consumer devices motivated us to define a richer methodology for color constancy evaluation. To this extent, temporal and spatial stability are defined here to determine the degree of sensitivity of color constancy algorithms to variations in the scene that do not depend on the illuminant source, such as moving subjects or a moving camera. Our evaluation methodology is applied to compare several color constancy algorithms on stable sequences belonging to the Gray Ball and Burst Color Constancy video datasets. The stable sequences, identified using a general-purpose procedure, are made available for public download to encourage future research. Our investigation proves the importance of evaluating color constancy algorithms according to multiple metrics, instead of angular error alone. For example, the popular fully convolutional color constancy with confidence-weighted pooling algorithm is consistently the best performing solution for error evaluation, but it is often surpassed in terms of stability by the traditional gray edge algorithm, and by the more recent sensor-independent illumination estimation algorithm.},
